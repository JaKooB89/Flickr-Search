# Flickr Search App

## Author

Created by Jakub Czaja (jakoob89@gmail.com) as a technical test for Formedix

## Development

App created with no prior Angular knowledge.

Live version can be found here: https://jakoob.co.uk/Flickr-Search

Although the app is not quite finished (e.g. no infinite scroll functionality), I did my best to complete it in under 4 hours.

## Tools used

Angular 8

Angular Material (design components)

HammerJS (touch gestures)

jQuery (required dependency for fancybox)

Fancybox 3 (image gallery)
